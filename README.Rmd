**This is a work in progress package. Features may be unstable.**

The repository contains the `macrtools`, which is a macOS-only _R_ package. 
The package is setup to re-create the compiled code toolchain for the
[CRAN official macOS _R_ binary](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) that
handles setting up the macOS R development toolchain as described on the
[macOS `tools` r-project developer page](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/).

**Note:** The installer package was developed by [James Joseph Balamuta](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/) 
and has no connection with the R projectâ€™s macOS CRAN maintainers.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `macrtools` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rmacoslib/macrtools")
```

## Usage

The package is designed to help diagnose, install, and uninstall different 
parts of the macOS R compilation toolchain. 

### Diagnose

The package features two tools that seek to identify if core components are installed: 

```r
# We can check if Xcode CLI is present using:
macrtools::is_xcode_cli_installed()

# We can verify gfortran is present as well
macrtools::is_gfortran_installed()
```

### Installation

The next set of functions focus primarily on installing 
different binary packages into the required locations. 

```r
# todo: finish xcode_cli headless install
# macrtools::xcode_cli_install() # not available

# We can install gfortran using:
macrtools::gfortran_install()

# And other binaries required for compiling R using:
macrtools::recipes_binary_install('r-base-dev')
```

### Uninstall

If we no longer have interest in having development tools present, we can
remove the development tools using: 

```r
# We can remove Xcode CLI using
macrtools::xcode_cli_uninstall()
# Note: To remove Xcode app, you must manually do it! 

# We can uninstall gfortran using:
macrtools::gfortran_uninstall()
```
