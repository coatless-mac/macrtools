The repository contains the `macrtools`, which is a macOS-only _R_ package. 
The package is setup to re-create the compiled code toolchain for the
[CRAN official macOS _R_ binary](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) that
handles setting up the macOS R development toolchain as described on the
[macOS `tools` r-project developer page](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/).

**Note:** The installer package was developed by [James Joseph Balamuta](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/) 
and has no connection with the R projectâ€™s macOS CRAN maintainers.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `macrtools` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rmacoslib/macrtools")
```
